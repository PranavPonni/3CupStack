# 3CupStack
Code for a 4DOF arm to stack two cups and one cup on top in the middle

Used joint angles to allow the robot to learn position of cup placements and movement of robot arm. With the given joint angles the robot works its way to the coordinates to place the cup on top of each other. Took a while actually, to correct the coordinates and make sure the robot didn't jitter due to servo current pull.
